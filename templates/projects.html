        <h2>Sports Attendance Visualisation Tracker</h2>
        <p>
            For my Year 12 Software Engineering HSC major work, I built a sports attendance tracker that takes 
            in sports data and visualizes it through charts, graphs, and tables. It was 
            a full-stack project using Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project taught me a lot about database management, data visualization, 
            and creating user-friendly interfaces.

        <h2>This Portfolio Website</h2>
        <p>
            Building this website without Bootstrap was a bit of a challenge since I had 
            to relearn some CSS fundamentals. But it was really fun figuring out how to 
            style everything from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Flask.

            I'm always working on something new. Right now I'm in the middle of creating a calculator. Every project is a 
            chance to learn and grow! I was abit busy with hsc last year but now i can finally build everything i wanted to!
