    </div>
    
    <div class="info-block">
        <h2>Python (2 years)</h2>
        <p>
            Python is my main language and the one I'm most comfortable with. It was the first language i learnt
            and I've used it for everything from data processing to building web 
            applications with Flask. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-block">
        <h2>HTML & CSS (1 year)</h2>
        <p>
            I've been working with HTML and CSS for about a year now. Building this 
            website from scratch without Bootstrap really helped me understand how 
            layouts, flexbox, and styling actually work under the hood. I started learning it for my hsc major work.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-block">
        <h2>SQL (1 year)</h2>
        <p>
            I learned SQL through my HSC project where I built a database to manage and 
            query sports attendance data. Understanding databases and how to efficiently 
            retrieve information through normalisation has been super useful.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-block">
        <h2>C (Currently Learning)</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently learning C on the side to prepare for COMP1511. It's a big 
            shift from Python since I have to think about memory management and pointers, 
            but it's giving me a deeper understanding of how computers actually work.
        </p>

    <div class="info-block">
        <h2>P.S. - I also speak a bit of French!</h2>
        <p>
            Since I'm Mauritian, I can speak a bit of French. Not quite coding, but 
            still a language worth mentioning!
        </p>
