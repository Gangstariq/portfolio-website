        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>
            I'm into casual Valorant and Minecraft. Im currently on my way to plat 3, while Minecraft is 
            perfect for just chilling and playing random mods with friends.

        <h2>Playing Pool</h2>
        <p>
            Pool is one of my favorite ways to hang out. There's something satisfying 
            about sinking every shot. Plus it's a great way to just talk.

        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <p>
            I recently started getting into cooking and it's been awesome. I've been 
            making tacos, experimenting with different recipes, and learning as I go. 
            I've recently realised it is kinda like coding where you follow a recipe, 
            tweak it, and see what taste the best!

        <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
        <p>
            My friend recently got me into Mountain biking and i love it now. Cycling through trails and jumping over rocks and weaving through trees is so fun.
            The concentration required to just focus on the bike really clears my mind.

    <div class="info-block">
        <h2>Meeting People</h2>
        <p>
            I love meeting new people and hearing their stories. Whether it's at uni  
            or just hanging out, connecting with others is what makes 
            life interesting.
