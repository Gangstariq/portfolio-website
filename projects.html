        <h2>Sports Attendance Visualisation Tracker</h2>
        <p>
            For my Year 12 Software Engineering HSC major work, I built a sports attendance tracker that takes 
            in sports data and visualises it through charts, graphs, and tables. It was 
            a full-stack project using Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project taught me a lot about database management, data visualisation, 
            and creating user friendly interfaces. 
        </p>
    </br>
        </p>   
            (The project is private on my github because i have still have to fix my .gitignore due to school policy with the database)

        <h2>This Portfolio Website</h2>
        <p>
            Building this website without Bootstrap was a bit of a challenge since I had 
            to relearn some CSS fundamentals. But it was really fun figuring out how to 
            style everything from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Flask.

        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>
            I'm always working on something new. Right now I'm in the middle of creating a calculator. Every project is a 
            chance to learn and grow! I was abit busy with hsc last year but now i can finally build everything i wanted to!
