        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            Hey! I'm Tariq, a first-year Computer Science/Commerce student. 
            I've been programming for about 2 years and I love building things with code.
        </p>

    <div class="info-block">
        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>
            I'm learning web development with HTML, CSS, Python, and Flask. 
            Every project teaches me something new and that's what keeps me going.
        </p>

    <div class="info-block">
        <h2>When I'm Not Coding</h2>
        <p>
            I love mountain biking, playing Valorant and Minecraft, playing pool with friends, 
            and meeting new people. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-block">
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I want to keep learning, build cool projects, and work on things 
            that actually matter. Always looking to improve my skills!
